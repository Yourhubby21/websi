    <h2>Philippians 4:13</h2><br>
    <p>"I can do all things through Christ who strengthens me."</p><br>
    <p>This verse helps me to keep moving even I am in the middle of many problems. I know it's not just me but there's a lot of people
        that has problem. When I am really stress, I think of jesus or the God itself. I know that they have dreams for me, they set a path
        that only I can walk as well as the others. They have plan for us all and we must believe in them.

    <h2>Isaiah 41:10</h2><br>
    <p>"So do not fear, for I am with you; do not be dismayed, for I am your God.
    I will strengthen you and help you; I will uphold you with my righteous right hand."</p><br>
    <p>In this verse, this means that you can rely on God and as what He says, do not be dismayed. Life must go on and surely, He will stay by your side, 
        protect you, and hold you tight to overcome the obstacles that you fear of.
