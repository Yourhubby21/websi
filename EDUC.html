    <h2>Elementary</h2><hr>
    <p>In my elementary days, I'm naughty and stubborn child. I would rather play cookery using my paper with my friends than listen to the teacher in front.
    Also, when I'm in grade 6, that's when I found myself listening and dancing to a k-pop song called, "I got a boy by Girls Generation". 
    </p><hr>
    <h2>High School</h2><hr>
    <p>Grade 7 - This is where my sleepy personality began. I always sleep in my class to the point that when I woke up, there are grade 8 students coming into our classroom.</p>
    <p>Grade 8 - Cutting classes, not attending to our specific subject and also if I don't want to attend classes even I'm inside the school because
        I rather be with my friends than listen to our teacher, that's been my life ever since I met my friends. I had so much fun being with them
    then I didn't realize that I'm doing the wrong things a student shouldn't do. </p>
    <p>Grade 9 - I enrolled in another school, felt alone. New environment, ambiance, new faces, new personality that I must go along with, but 
        I feel like I was too far away from them (my new classmates). So, I did cut class(again) and become a repeater student. And thankfully,
    my new classmates (repeater era), I get along with them. I just thought that I fit with them, I'm comforatble with them, and I like them. This was the days
    that first time in my life, I get recognized. I got to the top 10 honor students or with higher grades. </p>
    <p>Grade 10 - New classmates because it's not a block section and I become a friendly person. I got friends that I cherished and trust, they are good friends
        and us 4 became an honor students. I graduated with the highest grade (top 1) and for the first time I got 3 medals but I felt that my mother is not proud of my
        achievements in life.
    </p>
    <p>Grade 11 - I met people with the vibes I really love and my circle of friends, we all got a title "with honor". I became fond of them
        as well as the teachers in Jesus Reigns Christian Academy. We got an adviser that really helps us to achieve something that we barely know we could get (and we got it)
        TEAMWORK is what we got. We help each other and make good memories. I get to experience retreat where we spend a night in Amadeo, Cavite.
         We worship God, Listen to pastors about how
        they given a chance by the God, and there, I really felt God, talking to me, to us students. It was the best feeling and experience.
    </p>
    <p>Grade 12 - Pandemic begun. New normal. No more physical contact from friends. Online classes/Asynchronous classes only. No more gala after school.</p><br><hr>
